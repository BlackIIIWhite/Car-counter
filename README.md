# 🚗 Car Counter Project

Hi! I'm **Amit**, and this is a practice project where I built a **car counting system** that detects and tracks vehicles in a video stream.

---

## 📽️ Project Overview

- This project uses **object detection and tracking** to count the number of cars passing through a video.
- I implemented car tracking by taking inspiration from the **[abewley/sort](https://github.com/abewley/sort)** repository for the tracking algorithm.
- The video source used for car counting is freely available from [Pexels: Traffic Flow on the Highway](https://www.pexels.com/video/traffic-flow-in-the-highway-2103099/).
- This is a **solo project** built for learning and experimentation.
